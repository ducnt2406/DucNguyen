### 👤 About me 

👋 Hi there!, I'm Duc Nguyen, a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago. 

🧠 Passion & Focus: Ever since I started coding, I’ve been fascinated by how numbers can reveal patterns and drive smarter decisions. That interest has grown into a strong passion for **Data Analytics** and **Machine Learning**.

🛠️ I’m building my skills through coursework and projects, using tools like **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn** to analyze and model data. 

🚀 I’m eager to apply my knowledge through **internships** and collaborative projects that turn raw data into real-world insights.
