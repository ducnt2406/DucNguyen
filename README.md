# About me 

Hi there!, I'm Duc Nguyen, a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago. Ever since I started coding, I’ve been fascinated by how numbers can reveal patterns and drive smarter decisions. That interest has grown into a strong passion for data analytics and machine learning.

I’m building my skills through coursework and projects, using tools like Python, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to analyze and model data. I’m eager to apply my knowledge through internships and collaborative projects that turn raw data into real-world insights.
